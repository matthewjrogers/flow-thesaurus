# flow-thesaurus

As a writer, I find that jumping to the internet for a quick synonym or word definition is a quick route out of my flow state. By integrating these basic functions into Obsidian itself, you can avoid the web's siren call and get words on the page uninterrupted.

## Features

- Toggle between dictionary and thesaurus modes.
- Fetch definitions and synonyms directly within Obsidian.

## Usage

1. Open the Flow Thesaurus view from the Obsidian sidebar.
2. Use the toggle switch to select between dictionary and thesaurus modes.
3. Enter a word in the text input field and press Enter or click the Submit button.
4. View the results directly within the app.

## Merriam-Webster API Keys

To use this plugin, you need to generate API keys for the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus APIs.

### Generating API Keys

1. Visit the [Merriam-Webster Developer Portal](https://dictionaryapi.com/register/index).
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Navigate to the API Products section and subscribe to the Dictionary and Thesaurus APIs.
4. Once subscribed, you will receive API keys for both the Dictionary and Thesaurus APIs.

### Configuring API Keys

In the settings for the installed plugin, you will be prompted to add API keys for the Thesaurus and Dictionary features (you will need a separate key for each)

### Disclaimers

- **API Key Security**: Keep your API keys secure and do not share them publicly. Exposing your keys can lead to unauthorized usage and potential charges.
- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of the rate limits imposed by the Merriam-Webster API. Exceeding the limits may result in temporary suspension of your API access.
- **Usage Costs**: Depending on your usage, there may be costs associated with using the Merriam-Webster API. Review the pricing details on the Merriam-Webster Developer Portal. As of 2024, for non-commercial applications the API is free to use.
